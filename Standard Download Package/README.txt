In the current folder one should find 6 other folders:

1>> Java demo systems

In this folder there is the source code of three simple systems which can be used as a demo:
i)   Bank system
ii)  Benchmark
iii) Mine Pump

With each of the systems two batch files are provided to execute the system either with the monitors or without the monitors. Note that if the monitoring code is in the "larva" and "aspects" folders - these are directly generated by the Larva system (available in another folder).

In the "Larva example scripts" folder, two scripts can be correspondingly used with each of the first two systems respectively: bank.lrv and benchmark.lrv. The mine pump is intended to be used with the counterexample traces (This is note trivial to use since the compilation requires a manual intervention - please consult the manual). However the monitoring code available with the mine pump is the monitor corresponding to clocks.lrv.

Ensure that you have installed AspectJ before attempting to run the systems with the monitoring code. The monitoring code can be replaced by other monitoring code generated by the Larva system. Once the code is replaced, you can simply run the system again with the monitoring code and everything is refreshed automatically. Upon successful execution of the monitoring code, a text file with the monitoring log is generated.



2>> Larva converter

In this folder there is the compiled classes of the Larva convertor together with appropriate batch files to use the convertor. The convertor can function in four different modes:
i)   convert counterexample traces into a Larva script
ii)  convert "implementables" into a Larva script
iii) convert Lustre programs into a Larva script
iv)  convert a QDDC formula traces into a Larva script

More information can be found in the convertor user manual (available in another folder).



3>> Larva converter example scripts

This folder contains a series of text files with examples of counterexample traces, implementables, Lustre programs and QDDC formulas which can be converted into a Larva script using the convertor (provided in another folder). Once the Larva script is generated, the events section should be manually filled in and then the script can be used as a normal Larva script. As a test case the mine pump system can be used.



4>> Larva example scripts

This folder contains three example scripts written in Larva:
i)   bank.lrv
ii)  benchmark.lrv
iii) clocks.lrv
These can be compiled using the Larva system. The output of the compilation should be used with an appropriate Java system; eg. bank.lrv should be used with the bank system (provided in another folder).
Note that clocks.lrv can be used with any sytem because it does not require any external events.



5>> Larva manuals

This folder contains two manuals: a manual for the Larva system and another one for the converter.



6>> Larva system

This folder contains the compiled Larva system together with the necessary batch files to run the system.
